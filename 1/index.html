        I think that the difference in the image is a product of the characteristics of my phone's camera's lens. It is not a flat surface and because its curved standing very close to it exaggerates the curvature of the face. When my roommate stood far from the camera, the difference were smaller relative to his total distance from the camera which flattened his face.

        I think that the reason that the image taken from far away with zoom looks flat and compressed compared to the one taken without using zoom is because of how much light is able to be caught by the camera lense. from far away, light particles have a lower chance of being caught by the camera compared to close up which allows closer images to appear more detailed. The reason the close up doesn't look as flat is the same reason as my roommates face looked round in the last part.
